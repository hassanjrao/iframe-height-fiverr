==========
IFRAME
==========

1. Open course.html in your web browser (in the code, notice the initial source of the iframe is welcome.html)

2. Notice in the right column, after you load the page in your browser, you can only see the first paragraph (you should be seeing 12 paragraphs)

3. Ensure your solution does not display scrollbars, the iframe height needs to "dynamically" increase based on the contents, without the use of scrollbars (you can use inline javascript, but I don't want to use third-party libraries like jquery)

==========
COLUMNS
==========

1. Open course.html in your web browser

2. Reduce the size of your browser window

3. Notice the left column is displayed in the top position, this is wrong (the left column should appear "below" the right column on tablet/mobile screens)
